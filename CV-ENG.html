<h2>INSIGHT THROUGH REFLECTION</h2>
<p>Experienced Career Coach with a demonstrated history of working in the human resources industry. Skilled in people management, outplacement, e-learning, coaching, and job crafting. Strong professional with a Postgraduate focused in Economics.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<h2>CAREER STORY</h2>
<h4>Bachelor Educational Sciences & Master Industrial and Organizational Psychology</h4>
<p>📅 10/1983 – 09/1990 <br><br>
🎓 KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium <br><span class="extra-space"></span>
From my vision of the individual, I wanted adults to develop themselves. Emancipation of every human individual was (and still is) my finest professional goal: helping people become the captains of their own life.</p><span class="extra-space"></span>
<h4>Outplacement consultant</h4>
<p>📅 07/1992 – 12/1994 <br><br>
🏢 Curriculum Plus nv (outplacement services), Brussels <br><span class="extra-space"></span>
Re-launching people who had just been fired (from coping with a major setback, to rebuilding self-confidence and future orientation, to a successful restart) gave me immense satisfaction. But some stories could never end well. In those cases, I lacked experience or could not sufficiently distance myself from poignant personal situations. I was too young.
Personal learning point: giving people insight into themselves and their context so that they regain a powerful sense of competence? I can do that!</p><span class="extra-space"></span>
<h4>Training coordinator</h4>
<p>📅 04/1995 – 12/1995 <br><br>
🏢 DART Resourcing Group, Brussels <br><span class="extra-space"></span>
The poacher becomes gamekeeper. Having coached jobseekers to successfully get past recruitment and selection, I also wanted to be on the other side.
One big lesson: stick to what you are good at.</p><span class="extra-space"></span>
<h4>Opleidingscoördinator</h4>
<p>📅 01/1996 – 02/2001 <br><br>
🏢 Brabant career fund for technology sectors, Brussels <br><span class="extra-space"></span>
Coaching participants of jobseeker trainings towards a new job. Also organising, from A to Z, one-year training courses for jobseekers. I was responsible for 2 programmes ('industrial draughtsman' and 'logistics employee') with about 15 participants each.
One big lesson about myself: once I know how something goes I lose interest. Repetition of the same thing over and over again I find boring. Fortunately, all the participants were different.</p><span class="extra-space"></span>
<h4>Study service employee</h4>
<p>📅 02/2001 – 03/2009 <br><br>
🏢 Belgian career fund for food industry, Brussels <br><span class="extra-space"></span>
This job had two hatches: first, searching, finding and working out new bottleneck functions for which training could be developed. And then the training coordinators could organise them. The second component was assisting the CEO in preparing the training institute's policies.
One big lesson about myself: surely I have some professional ambition.</p><span class="extra-space"></span>
<h4>Postgraduate Degree, Business administration</h4>
<p>📅 10/2002 – 06/2003 <br><br>
🎓 KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium <br><span class="extra-space"></span>
Working student: executive programme in business administration</p><span class="extra-space"></span>
<h4>Manager</h4>
<p>📅 04/2009 – 04/2021 <br><br>
🏢 Antwerp career fund for technology sectors, Antwerp <br><span class="extra-space"></span>
Again, two major hatches in this role: 1. the day-to-day running of the organisation's business and 2. preparing the board meetings and translating the decisions taken there into practice.
One big lesson about myself: even this job, which had so much variety at first, I found in the long run a repetition of the same thing over and over again.</p><span class="extra-space"></span>
<h4>Study service expert</h4>
<p>📅 05/2021 – present <br><br>
🏢 mtech+, Flanders & Brussels <br><span class="extra-space"></span>
Finally, I get to deal with big questions: what are the big trends in our society / economy and what impact do they have on the daily performance of blue and white collar workers' jobs? The big trends I am following are: the energy transition, digitalisation / automation and 'Diversity, Equity and Inclusion'.
One big lesson about myself: I feel the need to share my insights, knowledge and experience as I did at the beginning of my career: one-to-one coaching.</p><span class="extra-space"></span>
<h4>Bachelor Philosophy</h4>
<p>📅 10/2020 – present <br><br>
🎓 Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussel <br><span class="extra-space"></span>
Insight through reflection</p><span class="extra-space"></span>
